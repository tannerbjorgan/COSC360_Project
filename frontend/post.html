        Kelowna dog owners are being advised to rinse their pet’s feet after a walk this winter on city walkways.<br/>
        Local resident Tracy Lessard says she recently learned that the city does not use pet-safe ice melt on pathways like the ones around the Parkinson Rec Centre where she walks her dog.<br/>
        “I just want to protect the dogs out there and just make sure owners know,” Lessard said.<br/>
        She is hoping the city can change to a pet-safe ice melt or place signs on walkways where salt is deployed.<br/>
        “Then you can choose to walk your dog where you wash their feet the minute they get in, if you still choose to, or not,” she added.<br/>
        The City of Kelowna, in a statement to Castanet, says they use a mixture of rock salt and sand or a commercial ice melt product on civic pathways.<br/>
        “There are alternatives available that are labeled pet-safe but they are less effective at melting ice and managing the freeze thaw cycle and their name is misleading as they are not truly pet-safe,” said Geert Bos, infrastructure operations department manager.<br/>
        “As our priority is providing a safe surface, we select the materials that will do the best job while minimizing environmental impact.”
